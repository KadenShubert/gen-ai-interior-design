# Stable Diffusion for Interior Design

## Problem Statement
An interior design technology company based in Edmonton aimed to enable clients to visualize their design ideas independently, regardless of their expertise. They also aimed to improve efficiency by reducing the time designers spent on creating mockups. To achieve this goal, the company considered using generative AI due to the creative nature of design. However, they needed to ensure that the generated designs could be practically implemented and that the necessary items could be sourced effectively.

## Solution
The solution involved fine-tuning a text-to-image Stable Diffusion model using a dataset of previously created mockups labeled with room styles and furnishings colors. This approach enabled the company to generate new mockups and designs while minimizing the risk of presenting unfeasible items or designs.
