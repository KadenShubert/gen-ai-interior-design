# Stable Diffusion for Interior Design

## Problem Statement
Interior Design technology company in Edmonton was looking for a way to allow clients to bring thier visions to life regardless of their skills, additionaly this would improve efficiency as designers using the app would spend less time creating mockups. This lead them to consider generative AI due to the creative nature of design, but needed to to ensure the designs generated would be feasible to bring into reality and that they would be able to procure the necessary items.

## Solution
The solution consisted of fine-tuning a text-image Stable Diffusion model using previously created mockups labelled with styles and colors for the room and furnishings. This enabled them to create new mockups and designs, while reducing the chance un procurable items or designs would be presented.
