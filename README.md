# Stable Diffusion for Interior Design

## Problem Statement
An interior design company based in Edmonton aimed to enable clients to visualize their design ideas independently, regardless of their skill level. They also aimed to improve efficiency by reducing the time designers spent on creating mockups. To achieve this goal, generative AI was considered due to the creative nature of interior design. However, they needed to ensure that the generated designs could be practically implemented and that the necessary items could be sourced effectively.

## Solution
The solution involved fine-tuning a text-to-image Stable Diffusion model using a dataset of previously created mockups labeled with styles and colors for both the room along with the furnishings within. This approach enabled both clients and designers to generate new mockups quickly, improving efficiency & satisfaction.
